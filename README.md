# Aether
Aether is a hobbyist Particle Life simulation built from scratch with C# and a custom SDL3 binding. The goal is simple: make many particles.  
Particle Life is a zero-player simulation where particles of different types attract or repel each other based on a simple force matrix. 

This project is intended to create as many Particles by leveraging the CPU. (Compute Shaders some other time *no promises*)

## Features
- Particles
- Input Handling
- Simple Camera

(It can handle 80k Particles with an influence Radius of 32 on my machine)
